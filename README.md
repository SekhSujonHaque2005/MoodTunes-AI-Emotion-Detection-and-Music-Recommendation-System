## ✨ Features

- 🎭 Real-time facial emotion detection via webcam
- 🎶 Mood-based music recommendation engine
- 🌐 Web interface built with Next.js
- 🔗 Spotify API integration for playlist suggestions
- 📊 Emotion analytics dashboard *(coming soon)*

## ⚙️ Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Emotion-Detection-and-Music-Recommendation-System.git
cd Emotion-Detection-and-Music-Recommendation-System

# (Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate   # Windows
source venv/bin/activate  # macOS/Linux

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## 🚀 Running the Backend

```bash
python backend/app.py
```

The Flask server will start at `http://localhost:5000`.

---

## 🧠 Model Training

Open the training notebook in Jupyter:

```bash
jupyter notebook training/train_model.ipynb
```

The notebook covers:
1. Loading and preprocessing the FER2013 dataset
2. Building the CNN architecture
3. Training and evaluating the model
4. Saving the trained model to `models/emotion_model.h5`

---

## 📂 Dataset

The **FER2013** (Facial Expression Recognition 2013) dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/msambare/fer2013) is used for emotion detection.

- **Classes:** Angry, Disgust, Fear, Happy, Sad, Surprise, Neutral
- **Images:** 35,887 grayscale images (48×48 pixels)
- **Source:** [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/msambare/fer2013](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/msambare/fer2013)

Download and place the dataset inside `data/raw/`.
